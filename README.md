# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection using VGG19

This project is a deep learning-based approach for detecting **Diabetic Retinopathy** from retinal fundus images. It uses a pre-trained **VGG19** model with transfer learning, implemented in **TensorFlow** and developed in **Jupyter Notebook**. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle, and a simple **frontend interface** is built using HTML and CSS for prediction visualization.

## Overview

Diabetic Retinopathy is one of the leading causes of vision loss. Early detection can help prevent blindness. This model aims to classify the severity of the disease based on retina images.
